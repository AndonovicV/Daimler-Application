how mt agenda and protocol are loaded:

1. Gfts are loaded from specbook and filtered through the selected module team (loaded from org_moduleteams)
2. Change requests are then loaded per Gft from change_requests table
3. tasks and topics are loaded per Change request afterwards

how a new task / topic is saved:

1. the clicked row is identified and the needed type is identified
2. DOMM then iterates upwards until a change request is found -> then a gft, or a gft immedietly (then the task is loaded directly under the gft)
